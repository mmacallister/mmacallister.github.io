Some of my hobbies are playing soccer, volleyball, basketball, teniis, and hanging out with my friends. My favorite TV shows are Friends, Arrow, The flash, Scrubs, and Friday Night Lights. My favorite food is Sushi and a medium rare steak with fries. I am originally from Bogota, Colombia. And I moved to Los Angeles 5 years ago. I have an older brother and an older sister. I love to travel and my favorite animal is a dog. </p1>
